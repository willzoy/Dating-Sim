    [Steady Delta Time]
        Version 1.2.0
    
    [Setup]
        Create a single instance of obj_SteadyDeltaTime, ONLY ONCE, at the start of your game.
        By default, obj_SteadyDeltaTime is persistent.
        Avoid accidentally destroying or deactivating instances of obj_SteadyDeltaTime.
    
    [Delta Timing]
        Delta timing allows you to adjust values at a consistent rate regardless of room speed or frame rate.
        Variables are adjusted by a specified change value over 1 second multiplied by the delta time.   
    
        Here are some examples of how to use the global delta timing variable [global.dt_steady]:
    
            pixelsPerSecond = 100; // Pixels to move during 1 second
            x += pixelsPerSecond * global.dt_steady; // Move x right by multiplying pixels per second by the delta time
        
            healthPerSecond = 5; // Health to add over 1 second
            health = health + (healthPerSecond * global.dt_steady);
        
            // Turn counter-clockwise by 45 degrees every second 
            direction -= 45 * global.dt_steady;
        
            // Update timer for tracking seconds elapsed
            timerSeconds += global.dt_steady;

    [Scale]
        Changing the delta scale allows for global slow/fast motion affects for all values using [global.dt_steady].
        You can change the delta time scale, at any time, by writing:
    
            obj_SteadyDeltaTime.scale = 0.0; // "Pause"
            obj_SteadyDeltaTime.scale = 0.5; // Half speed
            obj_SteadyDeltaTime.scale = 1.0; // Normal speed
            obj_SteadyDeltaTime.scale = 2.0; // Double speed
        
    [Minimum Frame Rate]
        To prevent sporadic delta timing values, a minimum frame rate is required.
        If the game runs slower than the set minimum, delta timing will begin to lag behind the step udpate.
        You can change the value at any time by writing:
    
            obj_SteadyDeltaTime.minFPS = 5;
            obj_SteadyDeltaTime.minFPS = 10; // Default
            obj_SteadyDeltaTime.minFPS = 15;
        
        It is advised to keep this at the default value of 10. 
        Values set too low can increase chances of sporadic behaviour.
        Values set too high can increase the chance of games lagging behind during heavy CPU/GPU load.
		
	[Unsteady Delta Timing]
		There are situations where you may need a "raw" delta time value.
		You can use "global.dt_unsteady" in such cases, when you don't want things steadied by a minimum frame rate.
		For example, this could be used for an "Idle Game" when you want to calculate a player's progress
		and include the entire time that the game's window has been out of focus.
		
			addCash = 25; // Money to add every second
			cash += addCash * global.dt_unsteady;
		
		(Only use this if you know what you are doing!)
